.SH DESCRIPTION
Valyria Tear is a free (as meant in the Gnu Public License) 2D J-RPG game
based on the Hero of Allacrost engine.

You can play it very much like a typical console role-playing game.
You can explore maps and talk to non-playable characters (NPCs),
fight active-time battles against multiple enemies,
