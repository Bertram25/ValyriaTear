                    and already select actions for them.<br />
                    The part above the action level is named the warmup time. Once a character has selected an action, this one is usually taking a few seconds before
                    being triggered. You can see that by the time taken for the stamina icon to reach the upper edge of the stamina bar.
                    The stronger the action, the more time it will take.

                    your enemies without too much pain before going further in a dungeon, or...<p />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; If all the characters' HP get to 0, then you've lost and a game over screen will ask you whether you want to restart the battle, or stop the game
                    and go back to the main menu.

                <img src="img/strength.png" alt="">&nbsp;<b>Strength (STR):</b> The Character strength represents the amount of raw hit points damage the character can deal to an enemy.<p />
                
                <img src="img/vigor.png" alt="">&nbsp;<b>Vigor (VIG):</b> The Vigor represents the base magical attack of the character and will affect the amount of attack spells damage.<p />
                
                <img src="img/fortitude.png" alt="">&nbsp;<b>Fortitude (FRT):</b> The Fortitude represents the natural armor of a character. His armor will reduce the amount of hit point lost
                when receiving an attack from an enemy.<br />
                It will also be used to determine whether a spell will win over the opponent's magical protection when dealing special effects to enemies.<p />

                <img src="img/protection.png" alt="">&nbsp;<b>Protection (PRO):</b> The Protection represents the natural armor of a character against Magic. Useful to resist against magical effects from spells and attacks.<p />

                <img src="img/agility.png" alt="">&nbsp;<b>Agility (AGI):</b> The Agility will permit to make you character go faster during the preparation time in battles,
                meaning you will have more chance to strike before your opponents, and more often than them if you have a sufficiently high value.<p />

                <img src="img/evade.png" alt="">&nbsp;<b>Evade (EVD):</b> The Evade value permitted to dodge enemies attacks. The higher it is from your opponent's own value, the more likely you will dodge its attacks.
                
                <h2>Combat Statistics</h2>
                Characters statistics are used along with equipment statistics to obtain Combat statistics. There are also 2 kinds of combat defense statistics. The <b>global character defense</b>, and the <b>detailled one</b>.<p />
    
                <img src="img/strength.png" alt="">&nbsp;<b>Attack (ATK):</b> The Attack is used as a base for any armed attack. It represents the amount of damage your standard attack will do.<p />

                <img src="img/vigor.png" alt="">&nbsp;<b>Magical Attack (M.ATK):</b> The Magic Attack is used as a base for any attack spell. It represents the amount of damage your standard magic will do.<p />
                
                <img src="img/fortitude.png" alt="">&nbsp;<b>Defense (DEF):</b> The Defense is used against standard attack to reflect your overall armor against them and reduce the amount of damage received.<p />

                <img src="img/protection.png" alt="">&nbsp;<b>Magical Defense (M.DEF):</b> The Magical Defense is used against standard attack spells.<p />
                
                Certain attacks and spells will also target a body part instead of a whole opponent. In that case, the detailled defense determines how well defended each boy part is.<br />
                Moreover, aimed attacks are easier for the victim to dodge, but usually come along with a negative status effect if successful, so watch your equipment carefully.<p />

                <img src="img/head.png" alt="">&nbsp;<b>Head:</b> Here, only your base Fortitude or Protection + your head armor statistics will count against the attack. A character can temporarily lose Vigor if hurt on that part.<p />

                <img src="img/torso.png" alt="">&nbsp;<b>Torso:</b> Here, only your base Fortitude or Protection + your torso armor statistics will count against the attack. <p />

                <img src="img/arms.png" alt="">&nbsp;<b>Arms:</b> Here, only your base Fortitude or Protection + your arms armor statistics will count against the attack. A character can temporarily lose Strength if hurt on that part.<p />

                <img src="img/legs.png" alt="">&nbsp;<b>Legs:</b> Here, only your base Fortitude or Protection + your legs armor statistics will count against the attack. A character can temporarily lose Agility if hurt on that part.<p />

                the characters can be affected by different type of positive and negative status effects.<p />
                
                There is 9 status effect types that can improve and amper your character throughout the game:<p />
                
                <h2>Effects on Statistics</h2>
                <img src="img/effects_on_portrait.png" alt="" /><br />
                During battles and in game, they will appear next to your character portrait to show how strong they are applied. When positive, a green arrow heading up will be next the effect,
                and when negative, a red arrow heading down will be shown next to the effect.<p />
                
                Every effect has a limited time of appliance and will fade out as time flies. Don't forget certain items and equipment can get rid of such effects.<p />
                
                The first 6 are status effects applied on base statistics. They can improve or decrease your character corresponding statistics:<br />
