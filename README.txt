Valyria Tear is an open-source single-player medieval-fantasy 2D J-RPG based on an extended Hero of Allacrost engine
and inspired by classic console RPGs. See: http://www.allacrost.org

The player incarnates Bronann, a young boy forced to take part into the struggle for the possession of a mysterious crystal.
This powerful artifact will lead him to discover the actual threat set upon his world, but also courage and love.

The game has all the features you can expect from JRPG classics: entertaining story development, colourful map exploration,
active side-view battles, character management, puzzles... It is also translated in several languages.

## Compilation procedure ##

**Linux compilation**
Once you've unpacked the tarball, if you have checked it out from the Git repository, run this first to get the latest luabind code:
`git submodule update --init --remote --force`
and then the usual `cmake . && make` from the top-level directory at the prompt.

You'll then be able to play by typing: `src/valyriatear`

**Windows compilation**
- **Code::Blocks:**

A [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) project file is also provided when compiling under Windows.
In that case, you might need the dependencies and headers files that can be downloaded here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/valyriatear/files/win32-depends/valyriatear-win32-depends-sdl1.2-2014-12-11.zip/download

- ** MSys/MinGW **

1. Download and install MSys2
   a. Download MSYS2 from https://msys2.github.io, either the 64 bit or the
      32 bit version, depending on which type of build you want to create
   b. Depending on your version, install to C:\msys64 or C:\msys32
   c. Run C:\msys64\mingw64.exe or C:\msys32\mingw32.exe
   d. Follow the update steps:
      https://github.com/msys2/msys2/wiki/MSYS2-installation#iii-updating-packages.
      Running 'pacman -Syuu' repeatedly and following the instructions on screen
      should do it.
2. Install the toolchain and the dependencies
   a. Install the mingw64 toolchain (or mingw32 toolchain)
      * 64bit: pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
      * 32bit: pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain
   b. Install CMake and all dependencies
      * 64 bit:
        pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja mingw-w64-x86_64-boost mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_ttf mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_image mingw-w64-x86_64-glew mingw-w64-x86_64-libpng mingw-w64-x86_64-libzip mingw-w64-x86_64-lua mingw-w64-x86_64-libogg mingw-w64-x86_64-libvorbis mingw-w64-x86_64-openal mingw-w64-x86_64-libiconv
      * 32 bit
        pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-i686-ninja mingw-w64-i686-boost mingw-w64-i686-SDL2_ttf mingw-w64-i686-SDL2_image mingw-w64-i686-glew mingw-w64-i686-libpng mingw-w64-i686-libzip mingw-w64-i686-lua mingw-w64-i686-libogg mingw-w64-i686-libvorbis mingw-w64-i686-openal mingw-w64-i686-libiconv
      * If any of the dependencies should be missing from the lists above,
        you can search for them on http://repo.msys2.org/mingw/
3. Configure the build
   * 64bit:
     cmake -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/gcc.exe -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/g++.exe .
   * 32 bit:
    cmake -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=C:/msys32/mingw32/bin/gcc.exe -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=C:/msys32/mingw32/bin/g++.exe .
4. Run the build: ninja
