*** \brief Manages skill selection lists and cursor memory for an individual character
***
*** Each character participating in the battle will have an instance of this class
*** created for it. The class has two primary functions. First, it creates and
*** manages OptionBox objects for the character's attack, defense, and support skills.
*** Second, it retains the previous selections that were made for that character.
***
*** The class retains three different types of previous targets rather than a single target.
*** These three target members are used to retain different target types (self, ally, and foe).
*** Party targets (all allies, all foes) are not retained since there are not mulitple possibilites
*** for those target types. The self target types also only have a single actor target (the character
*** himself/herself), but it is still used because the character can target multiple points on itself.

*** \brief Manages input and display to allow the player to select commands for their characters
***
*** This class is somewhat of an extension to the BattleMode class. It takes effect whenever a
*** character in the battle enters the command state, which in turn causes BattleMode to enter the
*** command state and initialize this class. The contents of the command supervisor are drawn to a
*** medium-size window in the lower right corner of the screen. The standard flow of this class
*** proceeds as follows.
***
*** -# Class is initialized with a character that has entered the command state
*** -# The player selects an action category for the character
*** -# The player selects an action for the character, which may be to execute a skill or use an item
*** -# The player selects a target for the action, finalizing the command
***
*** The player may backtrack through this flow of events and change their previous selections.
***
*** This class also enables cursor memory on a per-character basis. It does this by retaining an instance
*** of CharacterCommandSettings for each character. These objects retain all the previous selections
*** for the characters, as well as containing the option boxes for the attack, defense, and support
*** skills of the characters.
***
*** The ItemCommand and SkillCommand classes are assistants to this class, and this class creates an
*** instance of each type. Sometimes this class will receive notification messages to indicate when
*** certain events occur while the command supervisor is active. For example, if the character that
*** the player is selecting a command for is killed, this class will have to abort its operation.
*** Another example would be when another character has not used an item that they had intended to
*** (either due to that character's death or being unable to find a valid target). In this situation,
*** the item list needs to be updated to reflect the newly available item. Notifications are sent to
*** this class by BattleMode, and it may pass on some notifacations to the ItemCommand and SkillCommand
*** class where appropriate.
