*** \brief A collection of related text lines and options used in a dialogue
***
*** This class contains the most common set of data and methods necessary to execute
*** a dialogue on the screen. It does not contain any draw code nor does the class
*** "process" itself in displaying the dialogue. Instead, other classes are typically
*** employed for the display and execution of dialogue. Game modes which make use of
*** dialogue will likely require to extend the capabilities of this class to serve their
*** own needs. This class is designed with the expectation that other classes will inherit
*** from it and expand the base set of capabilities.
***
*** The standard order of lines in a dialogue begin with the first line that is added and ends
*** with the last. However, dialogues do not always progress in this linear manner and thus this
*** class supports "branching" of dialogue. Each line contains a pointer to the next line that
*** should be read. If no valid line follows, the dialogue will end after the current line.
***
*** Each line of text added to the dialogue has the following properties associated:
*** -# The text of the line
*** -# The next line that should be viewed after this line
*** -# An optional timer instructing how long the line should be displayed
*** -# An optional series of selectable options that the player may choose from on this line
***
*** An example of the typical usage of this class to construct a dialogue would be as follows:
*** - CommonDialogue new_dialogue(my_new_id);
*** - new_dialogue.AddText("This is the first line.");
*** - new_dialogue.AddTextTimed("Line #2 is displayed for 2.5 seconds.", 2500);
*** - new_dialogue.AddText("Select from the options below.");
*** - new_dialogue.AddOption("Return to beginning", 0);
*** - new_dialogue.AddOption("End Dialogue");
*** - if (new_dialogue.Validate() == false) cout << "Dialogue object is invalid" << std::endl;
***
*** \note The interpretation of the display time member of the dialogue is subject to intrepretation
*** by the code that is processing the dialogue. For example, the code may read this to mean that the
*** dialogue will automatically move on after the timer has expired, or it may mean that the dialogue
*** must be displayed for that amount of time and that the player can not force the dialogue to move
*** faster.
