-- this is a flat list of all the quest descriptions and their titles.
-- format should be as follows: ["unique_string_id"] =
--      {"title", "description", completion_description, completion_event_group, completion_event_name, location_name, location_banner_filename, location_subname, location_subimage},
-- When the event value of the completion_event_name in the completion_event_group is equal to 1, the quest is considered complete.
-- location_name, location_subname, location_subimage and location_banner_filename are optional fields, and they are used to display the quest start location and associated banner image
-- All fields can be empty but are required.
-- There are two more optional parameters: not_completable_event_group, not_completable_event_name
-- If those two are set, once the respective event is set to 1, the quest is considered not completable anymore
-- and a red X will be shown next to it in the menu.

-- Use the 'GlobalManager:AddQuestLog("string_id");' luabind script command to add a quest entry in the player's quest log.
